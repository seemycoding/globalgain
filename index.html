                  One of the key challenges of managing a portfolio is to regularly monitor and adjust the portfolio on
                  an ongoing basis as per your risk profile and in line with market movements. However, most advisors
                  fail to do so as it involves making multiple transactions frequently in a time bound manner. We have a
                  unique offering for our NJ E-Wealth A/c Clients called as 'MARS' that very effectively gives the
                  answer to this problem.

                  MARS is a technology powered tool which helps in managing asset allocation through periodic
                  rebalancing of portfolio which involves a research & logic driven scheme selection process. With two
                  broad asset allocation offerings – Dynamic & Fixed, MARS is the answer to client worries on portfolio
                  management.

                <p class="card-text">
                  Fixed income refers to any type of investment under which the borrower or issuer is obliged to make
                  payments of a fixed amount on a fixed schedule. For example, the borrower may have to pay interest at
                  a fixed rate once a year, and to repay the principal amount on maturity. Fixed-income securities can
                  be contrasted with equity securities – often referred to as stocks and shares – that create no
                  obligation to pay dividends or any other form of income.

                  In order for a company to grow its business, it often must raise money – for example, to finance an
                  acquisition; to buy equipment or land; or to invest in new product development. The terms on which
                  investors will finance the company will depend on the risk profile of the company. The company can
                  give up equity by issuing stock, or can promise to pay regular interest and repay the principal on the
                  loan (bonds or bank loans). Fixed-income securities also trade differently than equities.

                <p class="card-text">
                  A mutual fund is a professionally managed investment fund that pools money from many investors to
                  purchase securities. These investors may be retail or institutional in nature.

                  Mutual funds have advantages and disadvantages compared to direct investing in individual securities.
                  The primary advantages of mutual funds are that they provide economies of scale, a higher level of
                  diversification, they provide liquidity, and they are managed by professional investors. On the
                  negative side, investors in a mutual fund must pay various fees and expenses.

                  Primary structures of mutual funds include open-end funds, unit investment trusts, and closed-end
                  funds. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are open-end funds or unit investment trusts that trade on an
                  exchange. Some close- ended funds also resemble exchange traded funds as they are traded on stock
                  exchanges to improve their liquidity.

                <p class="card-text">
                  A capital market is a financial market in which long-term debt or equity-backed securities are bought
                  and sold. Capital markets channel the wealth of savers to those who can put it to long-term productive
                  use, such as companies or governments making long-term investments.

                  Capital markets are composed of primary and secondary markets. The most common capital markets are the
                  stock market and the bond market.

                  Capital markets seek to improve transactional efficiencies. These markets bring those who hold capital
                  and those seeking capital together and provide a place where entities can exchange securities.

All our communications are encrypted by 256-bit encryption, and our data is hosted with top-tier hosting service providers. Also, our data is continuously backed up to ensure continuity of operations.
